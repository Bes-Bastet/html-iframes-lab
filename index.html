    <!--These notes are for when I revisit this HTML again.  Obersvations when validating this lab with W3C.  The 'width' attibute with '100%' was marked as an error (the 100% was marked as a bad value on element iframe: expected a digit but saw % instead. The framborder attribute was marked as an error and it was marked obsolete with CSS being being put forward to use instead of the frameborder.  Width was originally set to '600' and height was orginally '450' and there was a style attribute set to style="border:0;"-->
